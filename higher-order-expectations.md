## Overview

You may create expectations on `methods` or `properties` of the original expectation value. As an example, imagine you're testing that a `User` can be created within your system. You might want to test that a variety of attributes have been stored correctly.

```php
expect($user->first_name)->toEqual('Nuno');
expect($user->last_name)->toEqual('Maduro');
expect($user->withTitle('Mr'))->toEqual('Mr Nuno Maduro');
```

With higher order expectations, you can refactor that test to.

```php
expect($user)
    ->first_name->toEqual('Nuno')
    ->last_name->toEqual('Maduro')
    ->withTitle('Mr')->toEqual('Mr Nuno Maduro');
```

You may also access `array` keys to perform expectations on them.

```php
expect(['name' => 'Nuno', 'companies' => ['Pest', 'Laravel']])
    ->name->toEqual('Nuno')
    ->companies->toHaveCount(2)->each->toBeString
```

Pest takes care of retrieving the property or calling the method on the `$value` under test.

Higher order expectations can be used with all of [Pest's expectations](#available-expectations). Which means you can create tests that are both powerful and elegant - even creating further higher order expectations within [`each()`](#expect-each) and [`sequence()`](#expect-sequence) closures.

```php
expect($user)
    ->posts
    ->not->toBeEmpty
    ->toHaveCount(2)
    ->sequence(
        fn ($post) => $post->title->toEqual('My first post!'),
        fn ($post) => $post->title->toEqual('My second post')
    );
```

Your Higher Order Expectations can reach as deep into an object or associative array as you like. Once you perform one
or more of [Pest's expectations](#available-expectations), the expectation's scope will reset to the initial value again.

```php
expect($user)
    ->companies->first()->owner->toBeInstanceOf(User::class)->not->toEqual($user)
    ->name->toEqual('Nuno');
```

> **NOTE:** You cannot call methods and properties on your expectation value that conflict with methods in the `Expectation` API using Higher Order Expectations.

## Scopped

@TODO text from PR

By using scoped, we can by use of a closure lock an expectation in to a given level in the chain. This is very useful for Eloquent models, where you may have a child relation that you also want to check properties on without using repetitive calls. Previously, you would have had to repeat the same accessor chain many times or split out the expectation into two separate expectations. Now, you can use a single scoped method instead if preferred.

```php 
expect($user)
  ->name->toBe('Nuno Maduro')
  ->email->toBe('foo@bar.com')
  ->address()->scoped(fn ($address) => $address
    ->line1->toBe('1 Pest Street')
    ->city->toBe('Lisbon')
    ->country->toBe('Portugal')
  );
  ```
