## Pest PHP

[`Writing Tests doesn't have to be complicated!`](#)

Pest is an elegant PHP Testing Framework with focus on simplicity. It was carefully crafted to bring the joy of testing to PHP.

**Pest was built for humans:** The code syntax is close to the natural human language, making tests very easy to read and understand.

**Code easy to write:** Pest provides a clean and fluid coding experience, thanks to its declarative and functional code style.

**Elegance and productivity:** Pest Test Reporting is well-designed, practical, and informative. Errors and stack traces are beautifully displayed, making debugging lightning fast.

The Pest team would like to thank our sponsors:
