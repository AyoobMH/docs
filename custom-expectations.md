# Custom Expectations

- [Overview](#overview)

## Overview

You can use `expect()->extend()` to add your own expectations to Pest. For example, let's say that you're testing a number utility library and you're frequently asserting that numbers appear within particular ranges of other numbers. You could abstract that into a `toBeWithinRange` expectation.

```php
expect()->extend('toBeWithinRange', function ($min, $max) {
    return $this->toBeGreaterThanOrEqual($min)
                ->toBeLessThanOrEqual($max);
});

test('numeric ranges', function () {
    expect(100)->toBeWithinRange(90, 110);
});
```

Those custom expectations may be also placed in your `tests/Pest.php` file.
